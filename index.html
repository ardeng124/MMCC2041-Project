            <p>Volcanic eruptions are catastrophic natural disasters that can bring about destruction and chaos to local ecosystems and
            settlements as well as global climate.
            <br><br>
            Due to the large amounts of ash expelled into the air global travel and weather is affected.

            <b>This article will provide a basic overview of volcano formation, eruption, and impacts.</b>

            <h2> Living with volcanoes</h2>
            <p>While what has just been said would make you assume living near volcanoes is unwise, volcanic deposits can be very good
                locations for agriculture.
                Volcanic soil is rich with magnesium and potassium, making them very fertile. Volcanic ash retains moisture longer than
                most soil, also making it useful for farming.
                <br><br>
                Volcanic activity can be very useful for energy, as heat from them can be harnessed for electricity.
                <br><br>
                Volcanoes are also good locations for mineral deposits, which are produced when rocks are heated to extreme temperatures
                by lava. In the country of Cyprus, water was heated to extreme temperatures by an eruption, causing it to become acidic
                and melt through rock to reveal copper deposits.

            <h2> Impact on culture</h2>
            <p>
                Eruptions also commonly cause further earthquakes and tsunamis, adding to the destruction.
                <br><br>
                Due to the destructive and catastrophic nature of volcanic eruptions, they have had significant impact on cultures near
                them.
                <br><br><br>
                
                One particularly significant impact was the Krakatoa eruption of 1883 which inspired the painting “The Scream” By
                Edward Munch.
                <br><br>
                His journal quote <i>“Suddenly the sky turned blood red, There was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and
                the city—my friends walked on, and I stood alone, trembling with anxiety. I felt a great, unending scream piercing
                through nature.” <a href = "https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-art-and-history-shaped-by-volcanic-winters/" target="_blank">(source)</a></i>.
                <br><br>
                The blood red tongues of fire are believed to be dust and gasses that were expelled into the atmosphere because of the
                Krakatoa eruption.
